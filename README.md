## Main Features

### ‚úÖ **GraphDB Core**

- Efficient storage in OPFS.
- Real-time synchronization between tabs and devices.
- CRUD operations for nodes and relationships.
- Efficient serialization using MessagePack and compression with Pako.
- Enabling reverse or Radix Tree indexing through external modules.
- GraphDB supports external modules that extend its capabilities.

## Warning

This project is under active development. Do not use it in production environments until it reaches the beta or stable phase. Check the [Project Status](#project-status) section for more details.

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Beta
- **Completed Features**:
  - Basic queries.
  - Advanced queries.
  - Modules for AI queries.
  - Distributed storage.
  - Conflict resolution module (LWW).
  - Performance optimization.

- **Pending Features**:
  - Improve incremental Synchronization:
    Currently, when a change is detected in an element, the entire graph is updated in nodes that do not have the latest version. In future versions, incremental synchronization will be implemented to propagate only the specific changes, improving efficiency and reducing latency in distributed graph updates.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The API is under active development and may change without notice. Use fixed versions and check the [changelog](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/wiki/CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

### ‚úÖ **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Customizable role hierarchy (`superadmin`, `admin`, etc)
- Biometric Registration and Authentication with WebAuthn
- Granular permissions (`read`/`write`/`delete`/`publish`)
- Role assignment with automatic expiration
- Cryptographic transaction verification

### ‚úÖ **Security**

- Digital signature of critical operations
- Real-time permission validation
- Secure storage of roles in internal graph
- [Security Implementation](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/wiki/RBAC-Security)

> **Important Notice**: This project has progressed from its active development phase and is now in the beta stage. While it is functional and stable in controlled environments, it is recommended to evaluate its suitability for production based on the specific needs of your environment. For more details, please refer to the [Project Status](#project-status)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reliability Notice

This is a distributed database (P2P + CRDT); therefore:  
‚Ä¢ In extreme conditions (network failures, partial synchronization, or unconventional usage), unexpected behavior may occur.  
‚Ä¢ Any reported issues will be prioritized and resolved in upcoming patch versions.

The project has achieved the expected stability goals (such as conflict resolution, synchronization, and distributed storage), without intending to ignore the limitations inherent to distributed technologies (P2P + CRDT).

gdb‚Äëp2p has been rigorously tested with our common usage examples in such environments, demonstrating greater stability than many other well-known distributed databases.

### **Internal Dependencies**

Below is a list of internal dependencies and their purposes within the project:

| Dependency         | Usage                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@msgpack/msgpack` | Data serialization/deserialization in MessagePack format.                              |
| `pako`             | Data compression/decompression using gzip.                                            |
| `trystero`         | P2P synchronization for sharing changes in real-time between tabs/devices.            |
| `BroadcastChannel` | Communication between browser tabs to notify local changes.                           |

#### Additional Information

- **`@msgpack/msgpack`**:  
  This library is used to efficiently serialize and deserialize data, reducing payload sizes for storage and transmission.

- **`pako`**:  
  Provides gzip compression to optimize data storage and network communication.

- **`trystero`**:  
  Enables peer-to-peer synchronization, ensuring real-time updates across multiple instances of the application.  
  > **Note**: Among the available networks supported by Trystero, this project specifically uses the **Nostr** protocol for decentralized communication.  
  >
  > **What is Nostr?**  
  > Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a decentralized protocol designed for censorship-resistant global communication. It operates without relying on centralized servers, instead using a network of relays to transmit signed messages between peers. Nostr is particularly well-suited for applications requiring secure, private, and scalable peer-to-peer interactions, such as social networks, messaging systems, or collaborative tools.

- **`BroadcastChannel`**:  
  Facilitates lightweight communication between browser tabs, allowing seamless updates without relying on external servers.

> **General Note**: These dependencies are integral to the project's performance and functionality, ensuring efficient data handling and real-time synchronization while leveraging decentralized technologies like Nostr.
