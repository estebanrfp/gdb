## Main Features

### ‚úÖ **GenosDB Core**

- Efficient storage in OPFS.
- Real-time synchronization between tabs and devices.
- CRUD operations for nodes and relationships.
- Efficient serialization using MessagePack and compression with Pako.
- Enabling reverse or Radix Tree indexing through external modules.
- GenosDB supports external modules that extend its capabilities.

## Warning

This project is under active development. Do not use it in production environments until it reaches the beta or stable phase. Check the [Project Status](#project-status) section for more details.

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Beta
- **Completed Features**:
  - Basic queries.
  - Advanced queries.
  - **Recursive Graph Traversal Queries:**
    Execute complex, multi-hop graph traversals using the recursive $edge operator. This operator uses the source nodes as a starting point to discover and return all connected nodes that match a powerful sub-query, regardless of their relational distance. The entire traversal logic is resolved within a single, declarative query, eliminating the need for manual, multi-step lookups in the application code. The query engine is designed to handle deeply nested relational paths with exceptional speed.
  - Modules for AI queries.
  - Distributed storage.
  - Conflict resolution module (LWW).
  - Performance optimization.
  - **Intelligent Hybrid Synchronization:**
    GenosDB overcomes the limitations of naive P2P sync with an intelligent, dual-mode engine. It automatically exchanges tiny, compressed Deltas between active peers using a sliding-window Oplog for blazing-fast, low-latency updates. For peers that are too far out of sync, it seamlessly switches to a robust Full-State Fallback, guaranteeing absolute data consistency for everyone, no matter how long they've been offline.

- **Pending Features**:
  - No major features are currently pending. The project has entered a hardening phase with a focus on rigorous testing and stability improvements.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The API is under active development and may change without notice. Use fixed versions and check the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

### ‚úÖ **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Customizable role hierarchy (`superadmin`, `admin`, etc)
- Biometric Registration and Authentication with WebAuthn
- Granular permissions (`read`/`write`/`delete`/`publish`)
- Role assignment with automatic expiration
- Cryptographic transaction verification

### ‚úÖ **Security**

- Digital signature of critical operations
- Real-time permission validation
- Secure storage of roles in internal graph
- [Security Implementation](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/wiki/RBAC-Security)

> **Important Notice**: This project has progressed from its active development phase and is now in the beta stage. While it is functional and stable in controlled environments, it is recommended to evaluate its suitability for production based on the specific needs of your environment. For more details, please refer to the [Project Status](#project-status)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reliability Notice

This is a distributed database (P2P + CRDT); therefore:  
‚Ä¢ In extreme conditions (network failures, partial synchronization, or unconventional usage), unexpected behavior may occur.  
‚Ä¢ Any reported issues will be prioritized and resolved in upcoming patch versions.

The project has achieved the expected stability goals (such as conflict resolution, synchronization, and distributed storage), without intending to ignore the limitations inherent to distributed technologies (P2P + CRDT).

GenosDB has been rigorously tested with our common usage examples in such environments, demonstrating greater stability than many other well-known distributed databases.

### **Internal Dependencies**

Below is a list of internal dependencies and their purposes within the project:

| Dependency         | Usage                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@msgpack/msgpack` | Data serialization/deserialization in MessagePack format.                              |
| `pako`             | Data compression/decompression using gzip.                                            |
| `genosrtc`         | New Internal Module for P2P synchronization for sharing changes in real-time between tabs/devices.            |
| `BroadcastChannel` | Communication between browser tabs to notify local changes.                           |

#### Additional Information

- **`@msgpack/msgpack`**:  
  This library is used to efficiently serialize and deserialize data, reducing payload sizes for storage and transmission.

- **`pako`**:  
  Provides gzip compression to optimize data storage and network communication.

- **`GenosRTC`** (Internal Module for GenosDB) :  
  GenosRTC is the real-time communication module for GenosDB, implementing peer-to-peer connections via WebRTC with signaling over the Nostr protocol.

  This module was developed internally for the specific needs of GenosDB and leverages state-of-the-art cryptographic dependencies, such as `@noble/curves`, to ensure maximum security and performance.

  Enables peer-to-peer synchronization, ensuring real-time updates across multiple instances of the application.  
  > **Note**: Among the available networks supported by GenosRTC, this project specifically uses the **Nostr** protocol for decentralized communication.  
  >
  > **What is Nostr?**  
  > Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a decentralized protocol designed for censorship-resistant global communication. It operates without relying on centralized servers, instead using a network of relays to transmit signed messages between peers. Nostr is particularly well-suited for applications requiring secure, private, and scalable peer-to-peer interactions, such as social networks, messaging systems, or collaborative tools.

- **`BroadcastChannel`**:  
  Facilitates lightweight communication between browser tabs, allowing seamless updates without relying on external servers.

> **General Note**: These dependencies are integral to the project's performance and functionality, ensuring efficient data handling and real-time synchronization while leveraging decentralized technologies like Nostr.
