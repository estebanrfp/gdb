## Main Features

### ‚úÖ **GenosDB Core**

- **High-Performance Engine & Efficient Storage:** Utilizes OPFS for fast, local-first storage. The engine is optimized for extreme write loads, capable of processing tens of thousands of operations per second without blocking the main UI thread.
- **Powerful & Flexible Queries:** Supports standard CRUD operations for nodes and relationships, plus advanced, multi-hop recursive graph traversals to discover deep connections.
- **Real-time Synchronization:**
    - **Between Devices (P2P):** Employs an intelligent hybrid system (via GenosRTC) that combines real-time delta updates with a full-state fallback to ensure data consistency across all peers. This feature is enabled by initializing the database with the `{ rtc: true }` option.
    - **Between Tabs:** Uses BroadcastChannel for instant, local synchronization.
- **Optimized Data Handling:** Efficiently serializes data with MessagePack and compresses it with Pako to reduce storage footprint and network payload.
- **Extensible & Modular:** The core is lightweight, but its capabilities can be easily extended with external modules for features like advanced indexing (e.g., Radix Tree).

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Stable Beta
- **Current Focus**: The project has completed its major feature development and has entered a hardening phase. Our current focus is on rigorous testing, performance tuning, and solidifying API stability for the first stable release.
- **Completed Features**:
  - Basic queries.
  - Advanced queries.
  - **Recursive Graph Traversal Queries:**
    Execute complex, multi-hop graph traversals using the recursive $edge operator. This operator uses the source nodes as a starting point to discover and return all connected nodes that match a powerful sub-query, regardless of their relational distance. The entire traversal logic is resolved within a single, declarative query, eliminating the need for manual, multi-step lookups in the application code. The query engine is designed to handle deeply nested relational paths with exceptional speed.
  - Distributed storage.
  - Conflict resolution module (LWW).
  - Performance optimization.
  - **Intelligent Hybrid Synchronization:**
    GenosDB overcomes the limitations of naive P2P sync with an intelligent, dual-mode engine. It automatically exchanges tiny, compressed Deltas between active peers using a sliding-window Oplog for blazing-fast, low-latency updates. For peers that are too far out of sync, it seamlessly switches to a robust Full-State Fallback, guaranteeing absolute data consistency for everyone, no matter how long they've been offline.
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Optional submodule for fine-grained, node-level permissions, allowing owners to grant/revoke specific permissions ('read', 'write', 'delete') to other users per node, complementing the existing RBAC system.

### üß™ API Status: Stable Beta

> The GenosDB API is currently in a stable beta. We are actively adding features and improving stability.
> We recommend checking the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) as we continue to refine the API for its first stable release.

### ‚úÖ **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- Customizable role hierarchy (`superadmin`, `admin`, etc)
- Biometric Registration and Authentication with WebAuthn
- Granular permissions (`read`/`write`/`delete`/`publish`)
- Role assignment with automatic expiration
- Cryptographic transaction verification

### ‚úÖ **Security**

- Digital signature of critical operations
- Real-time permission validation
- Secure storage of roles in internal graph
- [Security Manager (SM Architecture)](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/blob/main/docs/sm-architecture.md)

## A Note on P2P System Reliability

GenosDB operates in a real-world P2P environment, which exposes the system to network uncertainties by design. Our engineering focus is on mitigating these uncertainties within our software through robust conflict resolution (CRDTs) and synchronization logic. While we cannot control external network conditions, our commitment is to the continuous research and development required to ensure the highest possible resilience of the GenosDB engine.

### **Internal Dependencies**

Below is a list of internal dependencies and their purposes within the project:

| Dependency         | Usage                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@msgpack/msgpack` | Data serialization/deserialization in MessagePack format.                              |
| `pako`             | Data compression/decompression using gzip.                                            |
| `genosrtc`         | New Internal Module for P2P synchronization for sharing changes in real-time between tabs/devices.            |
| `BroadcastChannel` | Communication between browser tabs to notify local changes.                           |

#### Additional Information

- **`@msgpack/msgpack`**:  
  This library is used to efficiently serialize and deserialize data, reducing payload sizes for storage and transmission.

- **`pako`**:  
  Provides gzip compression to optimize data storage and network communication.

- **`GenosRTC`** (Internal Module for GenosDB) :  
  GenosRTC is the real-time communication module for GenosDB, implementing peer-to-peer connections via WebRTC with signaling over the Nostr protocol.

  This module was developed internally for the specific needs of GenosDB and leverages state-of-the-art cryptographic dependencies, such as `@noble/curves`, to ensure maximum security and performance.

  Enables peer-to-peer synchronization, ensuring real-time updates across multiple instances of the application.  
  > **Note**: Among the available networks supported by GenosRTC, this project specifically uses the **Nostr** protocol for decentralized communication.  
  >
  > **What is Nostr?**  
  > Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a decentralized protocol designed for censorship-resistant global communication. It operates without relying on centralized servers, instead using a network of relays to transmit signed messages between peers. Nostr is particularly well-suited for applications requiring secure, private, and scalable peer-to-peer interactions, such as social networks, messaging systems, or collaborative tools.

- **`BroadcastChannel`**:  
  Facilitates lightweight communication between browser tabs, allowing seamless updates without relying on external servers.

> **General Note**: These dependencies are integral to the project's performance and functionality, ensuring efficient data handling and real-time synchronization while leveraging decentralized technologies like Nostr.
