# Contributing to GenosDB

We are thrilled that you're interested in contributing to GenosDB! Your help is invaluable in making the project better for everyone.

To maintain the project's integrity, please note that **the core source code of GenosDB is proprietary, and we do not accept pull requests for it**. However, there are many other impactful ways you can contribute.

### Submitting an Example (via Pull Request)

This is the primary way to add code to the project. We only accept Pull Requests for the `examples/` and `docs/` directories.

1.  **Explore the Library**: Familiarize yourself with the library's features by reviewing the [documentation](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/blob/main/docs/index.md).
2.  **Identify a Use Case**: Think of a practical scenario that isn't already covered in our [examples folder](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/tree/main/examples).
3.  **Create the Example**: Write clean, well-documented code. Ensure it is easy to understand.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request**:
    *   Add your new example to the `examples/` folder.
    *   Submit a PR and explain its purpose in the description.
    *   The maintainers will review your contribution. We only merge PRs that modify content within the `examples/` or `docs/` folders.

### Contribution Guidelines

- **Testing**: Ensure any example code you submit runs correctly.
- **Documentation**: Comment your code clearly. If your example is complex, add a small `README.md` inside its folder.
- **Issues**: Before starting a large example, it's a good idea to open an issue to discuss your idea first.
