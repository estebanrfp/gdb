## Central Challenge: Distributed Trust Without a Central Server
In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, how can peers trust each other when there’s no central authority? GenosDB addresses this with a layered architecture based on three core principles:

- **Cryptographic Identity:** Each user is identified by their Ethereum address, secured by a private key (protected via WebAuthn or mnemonic phrases).  
- **Verifiable Actions:** Every operation is digitally signed, ensuring authenticity and integrity.  
- **Shared Constitution:** Rules (such as roles and permissions) are embedded in the software and are consistent across all nodes.  

## The Security Manager (SM): Local Enforcer of Trust
Each node runs a Security Manager (SM) that inspects all incoming operations, verifying them against its internal rulebook. The SM does not trust any peer by default; it requires cryptographic proof and checks permissions based on its constitution.

## Defense Against Manipulation: The Case of Eve
- **Scenario A:** Eve, a guest, attempts to promote herself to a manager. Alice’s node:
  - Verifies Eve’s signature.  
  - Confirms her role as guest.  
  - Rejects the operation, since only superadmins can assign roles.  
- **Scenario B:** Eve alters her local client to bypass restrictions. Honest nodes, unaffected by her local changes, still reject the operation.  

This demonstrates that authority is granted through verifiable means, not claimed locally.

## Incorporating Superadmins: Resolving the Trust Paradox
- Superadmins are statically defined in the initial configuration (`sm: { superAdmins: [...] }`).  
- The SM first checks the static superadmin list before consulting the distributed database.  
- This ensures a secure and verifiable chain of trust.

## Eventual Consistency and Security Prioritization
- If a superadmin promotes Bob and he acts immediately, a lagging node might reject Bob’s action initially.  
- Once the promotion is received, the action is accepted.  
- Security is prioritized over immediate availability, ensuring actions are only accepted with verifiable proof.

## Conclusion: Emergent Security Without Centralization
GenosDB achieves trust through distributed verification: rules reside in code, actions are validated by signatures, and each peer enforces rules independently. No central server is needed—only proofs, a shared constitution, and cryptographic consensus.

## Overview in 3 Steps

| Step | Key Component             | Primary Function                              |
|------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Identity + Signature      | Ethereum Address + Private Key: ensures authenticity and integrity |
| 2    | Shared Constitution       | Embedded RBAC in SM: defines uniform permissions and authority  |
| 3    | Distributed Security      | Local SM without default trust: verifies each operation against its own rules |
