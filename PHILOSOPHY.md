> Hello everyone,

> I want to share a story with you. It's not just the story of a database, but of a dream, a technical journey years in the making, and a series of difficult decisions that have brought me to this point. I write this for my fellow developers, for the open-source community that I so deeply respect, and for those who, with good reason, are asking: "Why isn't GenosDB open source?".

#### The Origin: A Love for Virtual Worlds

My journey began many years ago as just another resident of Second Life. I fell in love with the idea of metaverses—of digital worlds with no limits other than the imagination. That passion led me to build my own grid with OpenSim. It was a wonderful technical experience where I learned the ins and outs of a persistent universe, but I ran up against its nature: it was centralized. My mind, however, was already fascinated by distributed and decentralized systems.

I began a deep dive. I studied IPFS, OrbitDB, YJS, and many other open-source solutions. Each was a brilliant piece of engineering, but none of them fit perfectly with the vision that was beginning to form in my mind.

#### The Encounter with GunDB: A Community and a Learning Experience

And then I found GunDB. It was love at first sight, technologically speaking. Mark Nadal's vision and the warmth of his community drew me in. It wasn't just the code; it was the philosophy. I felt so inspired that I wanted to participate actively. I proposed improving the documentation and, with Mark's support, I dived into the depths of Gun, learning not only about its virtues but also about the complex art of making decisions in an open-source community.

For a long time, GunDB was my tool. I made friends, collaborated on projects, and felt part of something bigger. But my personal dream kept calling.

#### The Challenge: The Pursuit of Extreme Performance

My dream was to build **a large-scale distributed metaverse**: a virtual world that would break the barriers I had encountered, with no coordinate limits and a truly infinite space. And, above all, I wanted it to be so performant that it could run smoothly on Virtual Reality devices.

This is where my path began to diverge. As I pushed GunDB to its limits in my tests for **this project**, I hit a performance wall. The resource consumption was an insurmountable obstacle for the VR experience I was aiming for. GunDB is a fantastic technology, and my experience with it was an immense learning opportunity. The turning point came when I realized that the extreme demands of my vision required a solution designed from the ground up for that specific purpose.

#### The Creation of GenosDB: An Act of Necessity

After much deliberation, I made the most difficult decision: if the tool I needed didn't exist, I would have to build it. Thus, **GenosDB** was born. My philosophy was radical and direct: to do away with heavy libraries, frameworks, and anything that could be redesigned with an obsessive focus on performance optimization.

#### Intellectual Property: A Decision of Focus, Quality, and Future

And this brings me to the heart of this message. Why do I protect the intellectual property and only share the minified files and the bundle for free?

My development philosophy is summarized in one phrase: **"less is more"**. This minimalist and uncompromising approach has allowed me to advance in a very short time what takes other developments years, and the tests I've run bear this out. Protecting the intellectual property is the tool that allows me to maintain that purity and speed.

My reasons revolve around one word: **responsibility**.

1.  **Responsibility for Focus (The Vision of GenosDB):** My unwavering focus is on building a high-performance database, without distractions. Maintaining direct control allows me to make the bold and rapid architectural decisions necessary to achieve this goal, without straying from the path.

2.  **Responsibility for Quality (Avoiding "Technical Wear and Tear"):** My name is behind GenosDB, and I feel a personal responsibility for its quality. We all know that an open-source project has enormous advantages. However, it is also prone to long-term **"technical wear and tear"**: the weight of endless discussions, design by committee, and the friction that slows down critical decisions. It's a kind of wear that, at this moment, would simply not be worth it for me and would go against the agility that has made GenosDB so powerful.

3.  **Responsibility for the Project's Future:** I am building GenosDB to last. For a project of this magnitude to survive, it needs a sustainable path. By retaining the intellectual property, I am keeping all doors open: from the possibility of a serious company acquiring it and taking it to the next level, to creating a specialized team in the future. And this does not mean a solo path forever. I am completely open to bringing on key creators and developers in the future who are **deeply aligned with the 'less is more' philosophy** that drives GenosDB. But it will happen in a curated and organic way, not through an open pull request.

In short, my decision is a **resounding 'yes'** to a development model that prioritizes speed, coherence, and long-term sustainability for the specific vision that drives GenosDB.

#### My Commitment: Open Knowledge and Focused Collaboration

I immensely value the time and talent of the community. Therefore, my proposal for collaboration centers on the knowledge and the ecosystem surrounding GenosDB.

*   **Collaboration on the Ecosystem:** The core code remains focused to ensure its agility, but the ecosystem is where collaboration is welcome and vital. Have you built something incredible with GenosDB and want to share it? Pull requests to the documentation and examples are welcome, and we will create a space to highlight and celebrate community projects.
*   **Medium Articles:** Where I explain the philosophy, architecture, and technical decisions behind GenosDB.
*   **Exhaustive Public Documentation:** Every module, every function, documented so you can understand not just the "what," but the "why."
*   **Tutorials and Examples:** I have created numerous [examples](https://github.com/estebanrfp/gdb/blob/main/docs/genosdb-examples.md) to demonstrate the reliability and use of the applied technologies.
*   **Public Unit Tests:** So you can verify the reliability and behavior of every part of the system.

My fundamental approach is to deliver a **high-performance engine**—a solid and optimized foundation. This decision allows us to focus our collective energy where value is truly created: in building productive examples and real-world solutions. You, the community, bring the use cases and the creativity.

For my part, I commit to maintaining and evolving the engine, actively listening to bug reports and the needs that arise in your development process. Through this, **we will all collectively ensure** the agility and coherence of the project, until we can recruit a team of **highly skilled individuals** who will join this same commitment: to build the **best distributed database** possible.

#### An Invitation

This personal statement is my sincere answer to those looking for the "Fork" button on GitHub. For now, that is not my path. My effort is focused on accelerating toward the goal I set for myself years ago.

To all who have trusted in this vision and in my work, my deepest gratitude.

And to the entire developer community, I invite you to use GenosDB. Try it, push it to its limits in your own projects. I hope you find it as useful as I do.

I hope this tool serves you well. And, above all, **I am looking forward to seeing what you build with it.**

Thank you for reading.
